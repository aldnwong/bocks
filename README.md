# senior box (bocks) website
This website was originally created as a for-fun project to show off my senior box.  
My senior box (or "bocks") is a box I made with other friends, with the idea to fill it with different items from throughout the year.
Each of them have their own stories, relating to different memories and activities that I enjoyed throughout my senior year of high school.
This website would have showcased those items, but for lack of time and privacy reasons, I have decided to scrap this project.

This website uses a bunch of photos of the actual box to create an opening animation when you scroll down.
It would have opened to show a list of the different items that were inside of it.

The code in this project was originally written before I fully understood HTML/CSS/JS, so it was extremely messy and incoherent at times.
I've since updated the code to be better organized and look better than it was before.

Feel free to use parts of this project however you please.
